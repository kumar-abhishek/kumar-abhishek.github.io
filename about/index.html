			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I studied Computer Science at University of Florida, Gainesville and took the intense courses of Database Implementations(DBI, wrote a database engine from scratch in C++), Programming Language Principles(PLP, wrote a compiler/interpreter for a functional language RPAL in Java) and Concurrent Programming(in Java.). I will write more about these courses and my experience in a blog post. 
			
			During my masters, I did summer internship at Amazon, Seattle and I ended up joining there as full time after finishing my studies. Having worked with Amazon for 3 years, it was time for me to move on and I presently live in the Bay area.</p>
