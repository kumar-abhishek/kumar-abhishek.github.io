### Best source codes to read
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/README.md) (Great design, great code, great comments. All ANSI C)
- [Lua's VM](http://www.lua.org/source/5.1/) is powerful and fast, but small enough to comprehend in one sitting and is nothing but extremely clean, readable ANSI C.
- [Plan 9](http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/sources/plan9/sys/src/)
