<h3>How to make people laugh</h3>
<h4>My notes from the book : How to make people laugh </h4>
1. Read jokes: 
    * Make a note of them somewhere
    * get their gist so that you could recall them easily later<br>
2. Pauses are important:  
    * know when to pause. 
    * important to pause before just the punch line<br>
3. Be confident and don’t hurt people’s sentiments<br>
4. Great way to be funny is to increase your range of personal experiences<br>
5. What makes people laugh is sarcasm and deadpan[expressionless/blank] humor. You need to find cracks in the preconceived notion of people in a way that is provoking but ultimately non threatening.
