How to make people laugh
My notes from the book : How to make people laugh
Read jokes: a) Make a note of them somewhere b) get their gist so that you could recall them easily later
Pauses are important: a) know when to pause. b) important to pause before just the punch line
Be confident and don’t hurt people’s sentiments
Great way to be funny is to increase your range of personal experiences
What makes people laugh is sarcasm and deadpan[expressionless/blank] humor. You need to find cracks in the preconceived notion of people in a way that is provoking but ultimately non threatening.
