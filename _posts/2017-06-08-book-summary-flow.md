### [Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi book/ted-talk notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXIeFJCqsPs)

In the ted talk & the book, Mihaly explains the concept of Flow. He tries to define it as an answer to the question of what makes people happy. When a great musician composes music, he experiences awe and wonderment. But this awe is experienced only by someone who has been very well trained and has developed technique.
In the study of creativity, you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of technichal knowledge immersion in a particular field. 

**Flow can be described as the effortless & spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.**

#### How Does It Feel to Be in Flow?
1. Completely involved in what we are doing – focused, concentrated.
2. A sense of ecstasy – of being outside everyday reality.
3. Great inner clarity – knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing.
4. Knowing that the activity is doable – that skills are adequate to the task.
5. A sense of serenity – no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego.
6. Timelessness – thoroughly focused on the present, our sin to pass by in minutes.
7. Intrinsic motivation – whatever produces flow becomes its own reward.
